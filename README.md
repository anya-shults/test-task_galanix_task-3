## Clone this repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anya-shults/test-task_galanix_task-3.git
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can:

### Install project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm i
```

### Runs the app in the development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Builds the app for production to the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
